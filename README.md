# StatusWorkflow

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/faradayio/status_workflow_ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/faradayio/status_workflow_ruby)

Basic state machine using Redis for locking.

## Usage

```
require 'redis'
StatusWorkflow.redis = Redis.new
```

You need an object that has `status`, `status_changed_at`, and `status_error`.

Expects but does not require ActiveRecord (you just have to respond to `#reload`, `#id`, and `#update_columns`)

```
class Pet < ActiveRecord::Base
  before_create do
    self.status ||= 'sleep'
  end
  include StatusWorkflow
  status_workflow(
    sleep: [:fed],
    fed: [:sleep, :run],
    run: [:sleep],
  )
end
```

where

```
    sleep: [:fed],
    fed: [:sleep, :run],
    run: [:sleep],
```

means:

* from sleep, i can go to fed
* from fed, i can go to sleep or run
* from run, i can go to sleep

If you want >1 status, you do

```
  include StatusWorkflow
  status_workflow(
    nil => {
      sleep: [:feeding],
      feeding: [:fed],
      fed: [:sleep, :run],
      run: [:sleep],
    },
    alt: {
      sleep2: [:feeding2],
      feeding2: [:fed2],
      fed2: [:sleep2, :run2],
      run2: [:sleep2],
    }
  )
```

You need an object that has `alt_status`, `alt_status_changed_at`, and `alt_status_error`.
