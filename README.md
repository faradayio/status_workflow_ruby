# StatusWorkflow

Basic state machine using Redis for locking.

```
require 'redis'
StatusWorkflow.redis = Redis.new
```

Expects but does not require ActiveRecord (you just have to respond to `#reload`, `#id`, and `#update_columns`)

```
class Pet < ActiveRecord::Base
  before_create do
    self.status ||= 'sleep'
  end
  include StatusWorkflow
  status_workflow(
    sleep: [:fed],
    fed: [:sleep, :run],
    run: [:sleep],
  )
end
```

where

```
    sleep: [:fed],
    fed: [:sleep, :run],
    run: [:sleep],
```

means:

* from sleep, i can go to fed
* from fed, i can go to sleep or run
* from run, i can go to sleep
